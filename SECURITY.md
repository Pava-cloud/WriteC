## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see someone reusing my code without credit you can report them at my Discord @pavalp1. 
I will try and take it down as soon as possible or at least convince them to add proper credits.

## Properly crediting me

If you want to modify/use my code in public I want you to at least link the following:
the repository in question, my name as well as my Discord tag.
